	<div>
	<p>My favourite thing about you is your smell, you smell like, earth, herbs, gardens, a little more, human than the rest of us (50)
	</p> </div>

	<div>
	<p> I know I, should crumble, for better reasons, but have you seen, that boy he brings, the sun to its, knees every night. (51)
	</p></div>

    <div>
	<p> He says, I am sorry I am not an easy person to want, I look at him surprised, who said I wanted easy, I don’t crave easy, I crave goddamn difficult (56)

	</p> </div>


	<div>
	<p> I do not want to have you, to fill the empty parts of me, I want to be full on my own, I want to be so complete, I could light a whole city, and then, I want to have you, cause the two of us combined, could set it on fire (59)


	</p> </div>

	<div>
	<p> It’s your voice, that undresses me (69)

	</p> </div>

	<div>
	<p> I want your hands, to hold, not my hands, your lips, to kiss, not my lips, but other places. (73)
	</p> </div>
