	<p> Don’t mistake, salt for sugar, if he wants to, be with you, he will, it’s that simple (85)
	</p> </div>

	<div>
	<p> Did you think I was a city, big enough for a weekend getaway, I am the town surrounding it, the one you’ve never heard of, but always pass through, there are no neon lights here, no skyscrapers or statues, but there is thunder, for I make bridges tremble, I am not street meat I am homemade jam, thick enough to cut the sweetest, thing your lips will touch, I am not police sirens, I am the crackle of a fireplace, I’d burn you and you still, couldn’t take your eyes off me, cause I’d look so beautiful doing it, you’d blush, I am not a hotel room I am home, I am not the whiskey you want, I am the water you need, don’t come here with expectations, and try to make a vacation out of me. (97)</p></div>

<div>
	<p> Love is not cruel, we are cruel, love is not a game, we have made a game, out of love (127)
	</p> </div>


	<div>
	<p> I don’t know what living a balanced life feels like, when I am sad, I don’t cry I pour, when I am sad, I don’t cry I pour, when I am happy, I don’t smile I glow, when I am angry, I don’t yell I burn, the good thing about feeling in extremes is, when I love I give them wings, but perhaps that isn’t such a good thing cause, they always tend to leave, and you should see me, when my heart is broken, I don’t grieve, I shatter. (109)

	</p> </div>

	<div>
	<p> It wasn’t you I was kissing, – don’t be mistaken, it was him on my mind, your lips were just convenient (113) 
	</p> </div>

	<div>
	<p> Love is not cruel, we are cruel, love is not a game, we have made a game, out of love (127)
	</p> </div>
	
	<div>
	<p> I don’t want to be friends, I want all of you – more (134)
	</p> </div>

	<div>
	<p> You leave but you don’t stay gone, why do you do that, why do you, abandon the thing you want to keep, why do you linger, in a place you do not want to stay, why do you think it’s okay to do both, go and return all at once (139)
