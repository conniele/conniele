	<p> How is it so easy for you to be kind to people he asked, milk and honey dripped from my lips as I answered, cause people have not been kind to me (11)

	<p>You were so afraid, of my voice, I decided to be, afraid of it too (17)
	</p></div>

<div>
	<p> The idea that we are, so capable of love, but still choose, to be toxic (23)

	</p> </div>


	<div>
	<p> You have sadness, living in places, sadness shouldn’t live (27)
	</p> </div>

	<p> Father. You always call to say nothing in particular. You ask what I’m doing or where I am and when the silence stretches like a lifetime between us I scramble to find questions to keep the conversation going. What I long to say most is. I understand this world broke you. It has been so hard on your feet. I don’t blame you for not knowing how to remain soft with me. Sometimes I stay up thinking of all the places you are hurting which you’’ never cate to mention. I come from the same aching blood. From the same bone so desperate for attention I collapse in on myself. I am your daughter. I know the small talk is the only way you know how to tell me you love me. Cause it is the only way I know how to tell you. (37)
