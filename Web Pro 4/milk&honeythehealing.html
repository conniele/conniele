	<div>
	<p> Perhaps the saddest of all, are those who live waiting, for someone they’re not, sure exists – 7 billion people (157)
	</p> </div>
	
	<div>
	<p> Stay strong through your pain, grow flowers from it, you have helped me, grow flowers out of mine so, bloom beautifully, dangerously, loudly, bloom softly, however you need, just bloom – to the reader (158)
</p></div>

<div>
	<p> Fall, in love, with your solitude (161)

	</p> </div>


	<div>
	<p> Sometimes, the apology, never comes, when it is wanted, and when it comes, it is neither wanted, nor needed – you are too late (163) 

	</p> </div>

	<div>
	<p> The next time he, points out the, hair on your legs, is growing back remind, that boy your body, is not his home, he is a guest, warn him to , never outstep, his welcome, again (165)

	</p> </div>

	<div>
	<p> I like the way the stretch marks, on my thighs look human and, that we’re so soft yet, rough and jungle wild, when we need to be, I love that about us, how capable we are of felling, how unafraid we are of breaking, and tend to our wounds with grace, just being a woman, calling myself, a woman, makes me utterly whole, and complete. (169)

	</p> </div>
	
	<div>
	<p> Your body, is a museum, of natural disasters, can you grasp how, stunning that is (173) 
	</p> </div>

	<div>
	<p> You were a dragon long before, he came around and said, you could fly, you will remain a dragon, long after he’s left (178)
